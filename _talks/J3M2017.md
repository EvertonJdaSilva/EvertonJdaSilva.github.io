J3M - Journey of Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, and Mathematical Education
=====
Federal University of Paraná, Brazil

The significant demand from undergraduate students interested in developing and disseminating research projects triggered our decision to create an event in which they can:

* Present the results of their projects;
* Gain experience in preparing and presenting papers at scientific events;
* Learn about the work of colleagues from their institution and other research centers;
* Interact with other students and researchers from different areas;
* Broaden their view of Mathematics, envisioning the work presented by colleagues from different research lines.

In short, our main goal is to encourage the exchange of ideas so that the greatest number of students can come into contact with research and people from different institutions. With this motivation, the Journey of Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, and Mathematical Education (J3M) was born, an event aimed at undergraduate students presenting work being developed in Scientific Initiation programs, PET, PIBID, PICME, among others, all aimed at the production and dissemination of knowledge.
