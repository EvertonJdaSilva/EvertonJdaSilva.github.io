2025-04-24	Nonlinear Derivative-free Constrained Optimization with a Penalty-Interior Point Method and Direct Search	arXiv	In this work, we propose the joint use of a mixed penalty-interior point method and direct search, for addressing nonlinearly constrained derivative-free optimization problems. A merit function is considered, wherein the set of nonlinear inequality constraints is divided into two groups: one treated with a logarithmic barrier approach, and another, along with the equality constraints, addressed using a penalization term. This strategy, is adapted and incorporated into a direct search method, enabling the effective handling of general nonlinear constraints. Convergence to KKT-stationary points is established under continuous differentiability assumptions, without requiring any kind of convexity. Using CUTEst test problems, numerical experiments demonstrate the robustness, efficiency, and overall effectiveness of the proposed method, when compared with state-of-the-art solvers.	A. Brilli, A.

2024-10-29	An Inexact Restoration Direct Multisearch Filter Approach to Multiobjective Constrained Derivative-free Optimization	Optimization Methods and Software	Direct Multisearch (DMS) is a well-established class of methods for multiobjective derivative-free optimization, where constraints are addressed by an extreme barrier approach, only evaluating feasible points. In this work, we propose the replacement of this extreme barrier approach by a filter strategy, combined with an inexact feasibility restoration step, to address constraints in the DMS framework. The filter approach treats feasibility as an additional component of the objective function that needs to be minimized. The inexact restoration step attempts to generate new feasible points, contributing to prioritize this feasibility, a requirement for the good performance of any filter approach. Theoretical results are provided, analysing the different types of sequences of points generated by the new algorithm, and numerical experiments on a set of nonlinearly constrained biobjective problems are reported, stating the good algorithmic performance of the proposed approach.

2022-07-18	Integral Global Optimality Conditions and an Algorithm for Multiobjective Problems	Numerical Functional Analysis and Optimization	In this work, we propose integral global optimality conditions for multiobjective problems not necessarily differentiable. The integral characterization, already known for single objective problems, are extended to multiobjective problems by weighted sum and Chebyshev weighted scalarizations. Using this last scalarization, we propose an algorithm for obtaining an approximation of the weak Pareto front whose effectiveness is illustrated by solving a collection of multiobjective test problems.

2015-10-01	Desenvolvimento de Projetos em Robótica Educacional A inserção da Expressão Gráfica no ensino	Anais da X Conferência Latino-Americana de Objetos e Tecnologias de Aprendizagem (LACLO 2015)	This paper describes the implementation of projects development in the classroom using educational robotics as tool. The project-based learning shows as a great pedagogical practice to re-enchant the classrooms, in addition to providing a development of the currently required intellectual abilities. The experiment conducted consisted of a simple challenge, which students should solve using a robot, to develop the robot were used the methodologies of brainstorm and morphological matrix. At the end it was concluded that the proposal was satisfactory to be able to play an interdisciplinary activity, where the contents were experienced with meaning and intellectual and social skills were worked instinctively.
